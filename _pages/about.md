I am a Machine Learning Data Scientist at Talkwalker, Luxembourg.

I successfully defended my Ph.D thesis in Numerical Probability in June 2020. I was under the direction of [Gilles Pagès](http://www.lpsm.paris/dw/doku.php?id=users:pages:index) and [Vincent Lemaire](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/lemaire/) at the [Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation](https://www.lpsm.paris/) and [Jean-Michel Fayolle](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jean-michel-fayolle-68964930) at [the Independent Calculation Agent](https://www.the-ica.com/), a Fintech whose aim is to efficiently compute risk measures linked to counterparty default.

 My main research subject was **Optimal Quantization**, also known as K-means. I also had a keen interest for Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods and Stochastic Algorithms.

You can find the last version of my PhD manuscript [here](https://montest.github.io/files/thesis.pdf).
