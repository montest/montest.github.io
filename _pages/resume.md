## Professional Experience
<!-- ====== -->

* Machine Learning Data Scientist at Talkwalker, Luxembourg, from May 2021.
  I am using Deep Learning models in order to solve NLP related problems. Here are some examples of my projects:
    * Training classifiers using pre-trained multilingual transformers models.
    * Active Learning based training.
    * Meta-Learning for improving classifiers accuracy.

* Desk Strat at Deutsche Bank, London, UK, September 2020 - April 2021.
  I was working on the Synthetic Desk's (ETFs and Indices) migration to Kannon (New P&L and Risk tool used by trading).

* Quantitative Researcher at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, Nov 2016 - February 2020.
  As PhD candidate in collaboration with The ICA, I worked on the following projects:
    * Optimizing the ICA's analytic library using Optimal Quantization based methods (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
    * Identifying and *killing* bias in the xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
    * Implementing new regulatory risk measures in the library.

* Intern Quantitative Analyst at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, May 2016 – Oct 2016.

  The goal of my internship was to optimize financial products price and risk measures sensitivities computations. I investigated both Malliavin calculus and finite differences methods and concluded the latter offered the best optimization.

* Intern Research Assistant at LPSM (former LPMA), under the direction of Daphné Giorgi and Vincent Lemaire, Paris, France, Jun 2015 – Jul 2015.

  I explored short rate models (Vasicek Model) and their numerical simulation using trinomial trees. The results of the project can be accessed at the following link: [Trinomial Trees Simulation](http://simulations.lpsm.paris/trinomial_trees/)
