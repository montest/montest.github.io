## Education
<!-- ====== -->
* Ph.D CIFRE in Numerical Probability, Laboratoire de Probabilité, Statistiques et Modélisation (LPSM), Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI), defended the 24th of June 2020.

* Research Master in Probability and Finance, Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI), Sep 2014 to Jun 2016.

* B.S. in Mathematics, Aix-Marseille University, Sep 2011 to Jun 2014.

 I spent the 2013-2014 academic year on exchange with the ERASMUS program in the Lund University's mathematics department, Lund, Sweden.


## Professional Experience
<!-- ====== -->
* Desk Strat at Deutsche Bank, London, UK, from September 2020.
  I am working on the Synthetic Desk's (ETFs and Indices) migration to Kannon (New P&L and Risk tool used by trading).

* Quantitative Analyst at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, Nov 2016 - February 2020.
  As PhD candidate in collaboration with The ICA, I worked on the following projects:
    * Optimizing the ICA's analytic library using Optimal Quantization based methods (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
    * Identifying and *killing* bias in the xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
    * Implementing new regulatory risk measures in the library.

* Intern at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, May 2016 – Oct 2016.

  The goal of my internship was to optimize financial products price and risk measures sensitivities computations. I investigated both Malliavin calculus and finite differences methods and concluded the latter offered the best optimization.

* Intern at LPSM (former LPMA), under the direction of Daphné Giorgi and Vincent Lemaire, Paris, France, Jun 2015 – Jul 2015.

  I explored short rate models (Vasicek Model) and their numerical simulation using trinomial trees. The results of the project can be accessed at the following link: [Trinomial Trees Simulation](http://simulations.lpsm.paris/trinomial_trees/)
