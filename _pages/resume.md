## Professional Experience
<!-- ====== -->

* **Quantitative Researcher and Developer** at Abu Dhabi Investmennt Authority (ADIA), Abu Dhabi, from July 2023. \\
  I am part of the Data Curation team and work on NLP related projects.

* **Senior Machine Learning Researcher** at Talkwalker, Luxembourg, May 2021 - June 2023. \\
  I was using Deep Learning models in order to solve NLP related problems. Here are some examples of my projects:
    * Training classifiers using pre-trained multilingual transformers models.
    * Active Learning based training.
    * Meta-Learning for improving classifiers accuracy.

* **Desk Strat** at Deutsche Bank, London, UK, September 2020 - April 2021. \\
  I was working on the Synthetic Desk's (ETFs and Indices) migration to Kannon (New P&L and Risk tool used by trading).

* **Quantitative Researcher** at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, Nov 2016 - February 2020. \\
  As PhD candidate in collaboration with The ICA, I worked on the following projects:
    * Optimizing the ICA's analytic library using Optimal Quantization based methods (Pricing of Exotic Options in the interest rate world).
    * Identifying and *killing* bias in the xVA computation using Multilevel Monte-Carlo methods.
    * Implementing new regulatory risk measures in the library.

* **Intern Quantitative Analyst** at The Independent Calculation Agent, Paris, France, May 2016 – Oct 2016. \\
  The goal of my internship was to optimize financial products price and risk measures sensitivities computations. I investigated both Malliavin calculus and finite differences methods and concluded the latter offered the best optimization.

* **Research Assistant** at LPSM (former LPMA), under the direction of Daphné Giorgi and Vincent Lemaire, Paris, France, Jun 2015 – Jul 2015. \\
  I explored short rate models (Vasicek Model) and their numerical simulation using trinomial trees.
