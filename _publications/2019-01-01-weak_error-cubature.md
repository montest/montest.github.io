We propose new weak error bounds and expansion in dimension one for optimal quantization-based cubature formula for different classes of functions, such that piecewise affine functions, Lipschitz convex functions or differentiable function with piecewise-defined locally Lipschitz or α-Hölder derivatives. This new results rest on the local behaviors of optimal quantizers, the Lr-Ls distribution mismatch problem and Zador's Theorem. This new expansion supports the definition of a Richardson-Romberg extrapolation yielding a better rate of convergence for the cubature formula. An extension of this expansion is then proposed in higher dimension for the first time. We then propose a novel variance reduction method for Monte Carlo estimators, based on one dimensional optimal quantizers.
